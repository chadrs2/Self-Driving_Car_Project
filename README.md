# Self-Driving Car Project with a Raspberry Pi using the Raspian OS
This project contains code that can be implemented on a Raspberry Pi using the Python 3 coding language. This code is designed to be implemented on an already built car with 1 Raspberry Pi, running the newest Raspian OS, as the single-board computer controlling the car. See the **Objectives** point below to see what the code can make the car do.

## Objectives
### Achieved Objectives
Detect lane lines
Detect stop sign and stop car
Train car on built track using 1 Raspberry Pi camera as the only sensor
Drive car from the CNN (convolutional neural network) model built based on training data in previous step

### Future Objectives
Note: _As these objectives are accomplished, the related code will be added to this repository_

Detect a traffic light at an intersection and respond accodingly
Stop and avoid humans and other cars on crosswalks or on road
Implement LiDAR sensor to improve human and other car interaction/path planning
Add lights and blinkers to drive car in dark areas
